# image_modify_astro
Code to modify the images using different redshifts and distances.
May be buggy, submit bugs in Github Issues.
Before running the code, with the pipenv already installed run these:
`pipenv sync`
`pipenv shell`
Then you are ready to run the main code.
For more info, run `pipenv run python3 main.py`
There is also a bonus script fits2png.py, which modifies .fits files into .png files

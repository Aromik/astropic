Code to modify the images using different redshifts and distances.\n
May be buggy, submit bugs in Github Issues\n
Before running the code, with the pipenv already installed run these:\n
"pipenv sync"\n
"pipenv shell"\n
Then you are ready to run the main code\n
For more info, run "pipenv run python3 main.py"\n
There is also a bonus script fits2png.py, which modifies .fits files into .png files\n
